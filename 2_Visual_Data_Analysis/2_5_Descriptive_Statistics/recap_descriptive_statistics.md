# Recap: Descriptive statistics

- **What is the difference between the level of measurement and the pandas.Series.dtype() of a variable/ column in a data frame?**  
level of measurments is something describing the data and its interpretation. dtype() is a description of the variables. I could encode a cateogrical variable in a number code so dtype would be numerical but my data isn't 
- **What is the difference between Python variables and variables in statistics?**  
a python variable is a place holder for code / numbers / .. while a variable in statitics is a probabilty distribution function 
- **Why should you always look at the median and the arithmetic mean?**  
to get a feeling for the data set. if those values are similar it is more likley a gaussian distribution, if the diverge, its definitley not 
- **What is the difference between an observation and a variable?**  
the observation are data points while the variable is the function that tries to infer the random other data points we did not collect
- **Given two independent metric variables, why is their linear correlation coefficient zero?**  
because they are truely independent and therefor not correlated
- **Are two variables independent if their linear correlation coefficient is zero?**  
yes
